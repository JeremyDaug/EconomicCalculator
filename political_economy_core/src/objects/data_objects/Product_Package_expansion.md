This is a placeholder for thoughts on the Product Package System.

Short explanation, Products as they stand are fairly static. To create a variant requires the creation of a whole new product. For Expansions outside of common play, or only a handful of variants, this works well enough, but it creates a massive problem if we want lots of them. This is no bueno.

These Packages could be used for stuff like information and data, like market or black market data. It allows for market information to be personalized to pop groups and includes stuff like brand loyalty, ad campaign targets, and other stuff. And many more things which could be useful if allowed to exchange and be personal.

# Option 1 Market Specific Reservations
## Explanation
In this method, markets reserve global product slots for themselves to use locally. These slots are shared between markets, allowing them to use their own stuff internally. This works well and should markets need to share these internal products abroad, they can adjust, and eventually move it up higher. 

The IDs could be broken apart either by dynamic placements, ID's show up where ever, and are reserved as needed. Or with an ID Partition, make all values, say all values that start with 1 are market slots, rather than global slots.

## Forseeable problems
This is still messy and ultimately just complicates the issue further. While using variants like this certainly does help, it doesn't really 'solve' the core issue, it justs improves the existing situation.

# Option 2 Package Attachments
## Explanation
In this method, instead of solving it by creating variants, products as they are moved about include a space for an info package. This info Package would be moved with the products, rather than stored globally. These specific packages would likely need to be saved wherever they are.

## Forseeable problems
The extra space requirements, the extra cost of shifting the packages around, and the difficulty of saving these are all difficult problems that would need to be solved.
