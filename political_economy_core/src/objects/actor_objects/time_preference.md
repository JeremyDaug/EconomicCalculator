# Time Preference, the issue

Time Preference is a feature of a pop which defines how 'now' oriented it is. The higher it's time preference, the more it wants things now over later.

In Reality, Time preference is a private amalgamation of many factors in a person. Percieved Security, Risk Tolerance, Patience, Forethought, etc. So, for our system it needs some mechanism to create time preferenc.

# Time Preference, Implementation Theory

The Theory of how to implement it is that it would be tied to a Pop at least and possibly to all actors in general. It would be represented as the pop's Interest Rate, ie given a standard period of time (well say 100 market days for no real reason), how much interest would need to be gained across that time for the pop to accept that in exchange for current goods.

This value could be added to and modified by other things, Risk Tolerance, Estimated remaining lifespan, Mood (Feeling Secure, insecure, unsettled, desperate, etc), and any number of other things we could imagine. It would be modified as time passes, slowly but surely.

In more detail, this would likely be a 'secure' number, which represents the minimum interest they'd be willing to accept, assuming absolute certainty of the deal, followed by a multiplier from it's other statuses. Typically, the longer these statuses remain, the more the interest rate will rise or fall to match them. So, a pop that's low time preference, but feel insecure for a long time would see it's time prefernce rise consistently over time.
