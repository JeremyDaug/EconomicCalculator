Needed Sections:
    Breakdown Pages:
        Breakdowns need a page which takes existing culture/species/political group and
        a selected Population Group. From there, you can select the percent of each
        culture/species/party and save that. (0% values get dropped on save/creation.)
        This should work for both creation and editing.
