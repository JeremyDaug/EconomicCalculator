# The Time Block Mechanism
The Time Block Mechanism is a process saving mechanism which is used to improve process efficiency
while simulating the time requirements of work. Each Time Block (called Time in system) equates to 1 hour of time.

## Implementation
Time Blocks are implemented as a required product. This product is given out to pops each day and consumed to do
things. From there they are consumed to do various things. 

## Generation
Time Blocks are produced by a pop at the start of each day. They currently recieve 16 hours a day to spend.
The hope is to up this to a full 24 hours, allowing pops to purposefully lose sleep (and health) in favor of
work. An additional cool feature would be efficiency reduction (lost time) based on day/night cycles, which can
be recovered by various means (light sources, biological features, etc). The ability to create more time directly
would be considered either magic (Chronomancy), or sci-fi tech (General Purpose Artificial Inteligence). Outside
of these two things are a few options.

1. More efficient Processes, generally using more capital or requiring more inputs.
2. Improved Skill Level, reducing the time needed to produce units of labor.
3. Improved Organization, workers can be organized in various ways to improve their efficiency.
4. Automation, using machines to produce labor for a job, at the cost of a much smaller amount of higher
   value labor.

## Consumption
Time blocks are consumed in a few primary methods.

1. Rest, having more time resting is a good sign of being free, but rest makes one restless and encourages the pop
   to find new uses for that time.

2. Work, time (and the skill of the pop), are likely the largest section of time consumed. This work goes into
   productive activity. Time spent at work is generally not liked, but it puts food on the table, so it must be
   done.

3. Shopping, it takes time and energy to shop and they can't do it forever. By limiting their shopping sprees to
   require time, those sellers who offer a greater quantity and variety of goods cost less time. This improves
   efficiency and reduces the chances we look for the same thing twice in the same day.

4. Relaxation, consuming and using products to satisfy desires also takes time, so if something can satisfy multiple
   things at once it tends to be more valuable. This tends to be the quickest, but most consistnet.

5. Strategic Thought, planning and predicting takes time. Owners, Managers, and other leaders can expend time
   to recalculate or otherwise process how best to solve their problem. This is the most complex, but allows us
   to put a cap on how much time any organization can spend on it's strategy. 

## Strategic Thought
Strategic Thoughts is how organizations (FIGs) can act. Strategic thought costs time, but allows them to act in
various ways. We'll go over what here.

### Firms
Firms have a few actions they can do
- Raise/Lower Price, This is available without strategic thought, but only 1 product can be changed without it.
- Increase/Reduce Quota, this is also available without strategic thought, but again, only 1 product can be changed.
- Market Research, this action allows a firm to look at the results of the market broadly, and take that into
  account when they change their prices or quota. (excess demand/low supply, raise price/production)
- Competition Research, the firm looks to a competitor to see how their doing and try to use that info to predict the market,
  or beat their competition.
- Growth Planning, the firm sets a target for growth and/or expansion. If the firm has a sizeable pool of resources, they may
  seek to expand.
  - Adding/removing jobs.
  - Making new jobs. (adding/removing processes to a job)
- Restructuring, the firm alters how it is structured to try and improve it's efficiency.
  - Adding/removing a subfirm
  - Expanding into a new market
- Target Research, the firm creates a target for research to flow into. They can select if they have none or redirect if they
  already have one. This makes any random research flow into their prefered selection more likely, and if they have an R&D wing
  they can directly research it through that.

### Institutions
Institutions have their abilities decided by what level they primarily act on and what they represent.

### Governments
Governments are much more general in what they can do, but strategic thought would be used to define where they are looking.

### Hiveminds
Hiveminds are the same as governments for the most part, but have additional features.
