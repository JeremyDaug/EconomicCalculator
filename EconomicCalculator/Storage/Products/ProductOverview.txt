Product Overview Sheet

- Products are pretty much everything to the simulation. These are products that can be bought, sold,
traded, and used. Overall, abstractly there are only 2 kinds of products, components, and goods.
Goods are products which are used or consumed, and components are products which go into other
products. This division isn't too useful, so instead we combine them and abstract the details away.

- Product Substitution, Product Substitution is the method by which one good can be used as
  an alternative for another. Substitution has a few dimensions in which it can be 
  substituted.
  - First is by varants of similar quality, goods of equivalent quality levels are a direct 
    one to one, and the one which is most cheaply produced is the one prefered to be bought.
	These match based on the primary name of the product.
  - Second is by variants of different qualities. Variants with higher qualities satisfy 
    a desire for it more easily. One unit of higher quality satisfies more desire than one
	unit of lower quality. Like the first, it matches on the primary name of the product.
	Pops will always buy the most cost efficient product first
	- Current math, satisfaction = 1 * (Quality * 0.25).
	- *Possible option, higher quality goods are more effective when used in a process.*
	  Hold off on this for now, making conservation of mass/energy is still something
	  I'd like to make easy to have, even if it's isn't required. Maybe allow
	  substitutes for Capital and Optional goods which produce failure outputs rather than
	  process outputs. This would be easiest to implement and maintain my own sanity.
  - Third is by want, when a population doesn't want a specific good, but instead is seeking
    to meet some less specific need, such as food, shelter, protection, etc. These look for
	matching Want tags, and allow for a much wider variety of goods to qualify. Rules 1 and
	2 still apply.
	- Maybe allow this rule to follow with the second on Optional and Captial process 
	  inputs, this would be more difficult, but not impossible. Not worth the cost most
	  likely.
	- Contemplate Allowing this for maintenance of products, similar problem as the previous
	  however.


Subtypes
- Product
	This is a generic product, it may do something, it may do nothing, but it covers everything a 
	product NEEDS to do.
- Capital
	This is a product which is used to make other products but is not consumed by the process.
- Plot
	A plot of land in product form. It is used in almost every process, as work needs space to do it,
	and it's also very difficult or expensive to make. It has storage space, instead of taking up
	storage space. There are variants of this for each territory, but all of these are treated as equal
	for the sake of consumption. (How this will work needs to be figured out.)
- Building
	A combination of capital and a plot of land, it is where most jobs occur, and can store goods.
	It can add more space to a plot than the plot would actually allow through vertical construction.
	Like plots, these are 'unique' to territroy they are from, but otherwise treated as equivalent
	regardless of space. (Again, how this will work needs to be figured out.)
- Currency
	Currency is a unique type of product in that it is rarely if ever consumed by the population. It's
	value is in trading for other things. It has two subtypes, Money and Currency.
	- Money - is the direct commodity so Gold Coins or the like. It requires having the physical
	product on hand to trade.
	- Currency - is a rough equivalent to a bank note, or similar idea.
- Service
	Service is a good which cannot be stored cheaply but is often used in other	goods. For example, 
	labor is a service, as is electricity.
