Product Overview Sheet

- Products are pretty much everything to the simulation. These are products that can be bought, sold,
traded, and used. Overall, abstractly there are only 2 kinds of products, components, and goods.
Goods are products which are used or consumed, and components are products which go into other
products. This division isn't too useful, so instead we combine them and abstract the details away.

Subtypes
- Product
	This is a generic product, it may do something, it may do nothing, but it covers everything a 
	product NEEDS to do.
- Capital
	This is a product which is used to make other products but is not consumed by the process.
- Plot
	A plot of land in product form. It is used in almost every process, as work needs space to do it,
	and it's also very difficult or expensive to make. It has storage space, instead of taking up
	storage space. There are variants of this for each territory, but all of these are treated as equal
	for the sake of consumption. (How this will work needs to be figured out.)
- Building
	A combination of capital and a plot of land, it is where most jobs occur, and can store goods.
	It can add more space to a plot than the plot would actually allow through vertical construction.
	Like plots, these are 'unique' to territroy they are from, but otherwise treated as equivalent
	regardless of space. (Again, how this will work needs to be figured out.)
- Currency
	Currency is a unique type of product in that it is rarely if ever consumed by the population. It's
	value is in trading for other things. It has two subtypes, Money and Currency.
	- Money - is the direct commodity so Gold Coins or the like. It requires having the physical
	product on hand to trade.
	- Currency - is a rough equivalent to a bank note, or similar idea.
- Service
	Service is a good which cannot be stored cheaply but is often used in other	goods. For example, 
	labor is a service, as is electricity.
