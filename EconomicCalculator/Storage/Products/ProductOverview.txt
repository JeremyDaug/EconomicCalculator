Product Overview Sheet

- Products are pretty much everything to the simulation. These are products that can be bought, sold,
traded, and used. Overall, abstractly there are only 2 kinds of products, components, and goods.
Goods are products which are used or consumed to satisfy wants and needs, and components are
products which go into other products. This division isn't too useful, so instead we combine them
and abstract the details away.

- Product Substitution, Product Substitution is the method by which one good can be used as
  an alternative for another. Substitution has a few dimensions in which it can be 
  substituted.
  - First is by varants of similar quality, goods of equivalent quality levels are a direct 
    one to one, and the one which is most cheaply produced is the one prefered to be bought.
	These match based on the primary name of the product.
	- To give a direct benifit to buying/having higher quality goods goods of superior quality
	  satisfy the want or need they go to more effectively.
	  - Product Satisfaction = Unit * (1 + (Quality * 0.25))
  - Second is by variants of different qualities. Variants can act as direct substitutions
    for each other, often there will be marginal statistical differences in variants 
	(+/- mass/bulk, different inputs to produce, etc).
  - Third is by Want tags, want tags are attached to the good and allow them to be placed
    in want groups. These groups are arbitrarily defined, but allow for products which
	aren't variants to substitute for each other if it is just the want and not the specific
	product being desired.
	- Maybe allow this rule to follow with the second on Optional and Captial process 
	  inputs, this would be more difficult, but not impossible. Not worth the cost most
	  likely.
	- Contemplate Allowing this for maintenance of products, similar problem as the previous
	  however.
	- Possible Special Tags, these are tags which may look at separate parameters rather than 
	  the want tags.
	  - Status Symbol, Any product of quality level 4 or 5 .
	  - Frugality, Any product of quality 0 or 1.
	  - Horde, Any product with a lifespan greater than 100 years and is not consumed on use.

Subtypes
- Product
	This is a generic product, it may do something, it may do nothing, but it covers everything a 
	product NEEDS to do.
- Capital
	This is a product which is used to make other products but is not consumed by the process.
- Plot
	A plot of land in product form. It is used in almost every process, as work needs space to do it,
	and it's also very difficult or expensive to make. It has storage space, instead of taking up
	storage space. There are variants of this for each territory, but all of these are treated as equal
	for the sake of consumption. (How this will work needs to be figured out.)
- Building
	A combination of capital and a plot of land, it is where most jobs occur, and can store goods.
	It can add more space to a plot than the plot would actually allow through vertical construction.
	Like plots, these are 'unique' to territroy they are from, but otherwise treated as equivalent
	regardless of space. (Again, how this will work needs to be figured out.)
- Currency
	Currency is a unique type of product in that it is rarely if ever consumed by the population. It's
	value is in trading for other things. It has two subtypes, Money and Currency.
	- Money - is the direct commodity so Gold Coins or the like. It requires having the physical
	product on hand to trade.
	- Currency - is a rough equivalent to a bank note, or similar idea.
- Service
	Service is a good which cannot be stored cheaply but is often used in other	goods. For example, 
	labor is a service, as is electricity.
