Cultures Ideas and overview Doc

Cultures are a way to reuse and condense data about what a pop requires while allowing
for greater differences between cultures. For Example, a culture of "British", may
consider Tea to be a Daily Good, while "German" may instead see Coffee as a daily good.
Likewise, it allows for various bits of additional data like religious, political, or
other demographic tendencies to be included.

- Cultural Moral Foundations, This is just an idea, and instead of going to Culture may go
  to political group, but that's unlikely. The idea is that a culture has six moral
  foundations and in varying degrees. Each would effect how they interact with culture and
  how certain events (both random and systemic) would effect them. These would be on scales
  of -1 to 1 to make calculations based on them easier.
  - Harm, People shouldn't get hurt.
    - These people would be in favor of ameliorating harm and
  - Fairness, People should get what they deserve.
  - Liberty, People shouldn't be oppressed.
  - Loyalty, People should be loyal to the tribe.
  - Authority, People should respect authority and their social superiors
  - Purity, Integrity of form, whether through religion, genetics, or culture, out to be
    maintained.

All cultures have:

	- Name, and variant name, which must be unique.
	- Culture Growth Rate, the base rate at which the culture adds new members to it's
	  population, may be positive or negative.
	- CultureNeeds, What specific products the culure values or puts a premium on. 
	  These products will be bought first if possible.
	- CultureWants, What non-specific desires the populace has and will fill by any means.
	- Related Cultures, cultures which are related, but don't share a name. Related cultures
	  are easire to convert to or from.
	- Culture Tags, these are small and varied modifiers which modify how the populace acts.
	  Example tags include:
	  - Species Preference, this Culture is predisposed to attract members of a certain
	    species. This culture may prefer multiple species.
	  - Biologically Dependent, this culture is intimately connected to a particular species
	    making members of that species far more likely to convert to this culture.
	  - Species Aversion, this culture is unattractive to a ceratin Species, penalizing 
	    members of the species attempting to join and giving a bonus to those attempting to
		leave.
	  - Species Incompatibility, this culture is incompatable with some species. The
	    species will never convert to this culture and even if they did, they would
		immediately find another.
	  - Political Connection, this culture has a preference to a specific political group.
	    This increases attraction from this culture to that political group (and vice versa)
		[2] times. This stacks with a bonus from a tag the other way.
	  - Political Antipathy, this culture has a preference away from a specific political
	    group.
	  - Job Preference, this culture tends to gravitate to a specific job. Those with 
	    this job are more likely to be in this job than not. A culture can have multiple
		jobs this way.
	  - Disfavored Job, this culture is adverse to a specific job. Those with this 
	    culture have an aversion to taking this job, and those in this job are less likely
		to be of this culture. 
	  - Supremacist, they view thesmelves as superior to other cultures.
	  - Subjucationist, they view cultures further away from them as worthy of 
	    enslavement and subjugation.

Species Ideas and Overview

Species is a secondary additon to culture. Denoted less by the whims of culture and
preference but instead tied to their physical limitations. While culture can change,
Species can't without expensive genetic reworking, uploading, or similar change. Populations
treat Species and culture as separate and unless a species or culture is explicitly tied
to each other, it is assumed that a species may have any culture or a culture any species.

Species have:

	- Name, and variant name for Minor Genetic Alterations, which must be unique pairs.
	- Natural Growth Rate, the 'default' rate of growth.
	- Life Needs, this is specific products or items they need to survive.
	- Life Wants, this is less specific things that the species needs to 
	  survive.
	- Aversions, these are less specific things that the species wishes to
	  avoid. These use want tags in their search instead of exact items.
	- Anathemas, these are specific things the species wishes to avoid, variant items
	  are implicitly also included.
	- Tempurature Preference, their 'room tempurature' value, that they find most
	  desirable. There is a built in window of [[10]] Degrees C. Outside of this window
	  every Degree C increases certain wants (Too cold asks for warmth, Too hot requires 
	  cooling). At [[50]] Degrees C away from this point, it requires the maximum support
	  and an additional 'life support' need, which is much more expensive and difficult 
	  to produce. What this 'life support' is is TBD.
	- Gravity preference, their natural Gravity. a pop can reach [[10%]] higher or [[25%]]
	  lower without problem. Outside of these bounds they require more medical aid and
	  support. Lower G stops at 0 (obviously). High G goes up to [[50%]] at which point
	  more extreme support will be needed, if any can be found at all.
	- Detriments, environmental effects which have adverse effects, this includes stuff
	  like pollution, toxic gasses, or other environmental effects which may harm the
	  population. The value given, per pop, increases it's penalties up to the value
	  attached, at or above this value is considered lethal and requires life support
	  to overcome this.
	  - Like Life Requirements, this is split into generic wants (or aversions) and 
	    specific needs (anathemas).
	- Demographic Breakdown, this is the breakdown of the Species Demographic phases,
	  listing the length of each stage (in years) from Baby, Child, and Adult.
	  If any phase is of length 0, then any pop which enters that phase will immediately
	  shift into the next.
	- Average Lifespan, this is the average age of the population, it defines the typical
	  death age, though this is made fuzzier than other age brackets. This value, minus 
	  the sum of Demographic Breakdown, is the typical length of the Senior Phase of the 
	  species. This can be less and will drastically increase the death rate of older
	  members of the species.
	- Tags, as much informational as general purpose. Each should have some basic effect
	  that it follows.
	  - Existing Tags
	    - Unborn, this species does not give birth to it's own kind and does not grow
		  passively. Species like this often must build new members like a product.
		- Seniorless, this species does not enter the senior phase ever, instead 
		  dying in their adult (or previous available) life phase.
		- Deathless, this species does not die naturally and do not have an avegage
		  lifespan, instead they only die from secondary sources like accidents, 
		  environmental factors, or the like.
		- Drone, this species has no independence of thought, it has no happiness,
		  politics, or any other form of independent thought. It can still commit crime
		  though it is called deviancy instead.
		- Weightless, this species, whether gaseous or non-physical, is without weight,
		  allowing it to ignore gravity and it's penalties.
		- Tempurature Immune, this population Ignores any penalties from tempurature and
		  never needs support.
		- Tempurature Resistant, this population doubles it's tempurature window.
		- Aquatic, this species is aquatic, living under water instead of in air.
		- Preferred Culture, This species prefers a culture, giving them an increased
		  chance to convert to it, and a decreased chance to leave it. A species may
		  have multiple preferred cultures, converting from one preferred to another
		  bonus and penalty cancels out.
		- Innate Culture, this species has a specific culture that it follows naturally.
		  A species will never convert to a culture that is not innate to it. If it is
		  not part of an innate culture it has a 100% chance of converting to the 
		  innate culture. A species may have multiple innate cultures, in which case
		  they will act like normal cultures, having chances of converting between them
		  as normal. Preferred Culture also applies in these cases.
		- Unusual Culture, this species has a culture that it is disinclined from
		  joining. They get a penalty when converting to it, and a bonus when trying
		  to leave it. Should not have a culture that is both preferred and unusual.
		- Incompatible Culture, this species has a culture that it is incompatible with.
		  They have no chance of converting to it naturally, and if they do they have a
		  100% chance of converting out of it. Species may have multiple Incompatible
		  Cultures. Cannot have the same culture be both Incompatible and Innate.
	- Possible Options:
	  - Pressure Limits, covering air (or water) pressure limitations they have.

Species and Culture Wants, Needs, and Aversions and Anathemas

	Wants and Needs work effectively the same, though wants are general and
	needs are specific. Same with Aversions (wants) and Anathemas (needs).
	The amount requested is in 'units' of product or equivalent so all 
	products meant to be consumed should be given appropriate unit size.

	Along with this Species wants, needs, aversions, and anathemas have space
	for tags. Currently cultures do not include a space for tags, instead
	having a space for the type of need, this can be a life need, but a 
	daily, or luxury need should be more common.

	Aversions and anathemas have unique mechanics relative to other
	products as they generally create effects because of their existence in
	the environment and do not require the populace to conusme them, their 
	loose existance in the environment is often enough.

	Current Tags:
	Wants/Needs
	- Sustenance, this thing sustains the populace and is needed to keep them
	  alive, going without won't kill them immediately, but it will make them
	  die very quickly if not retrieved within the next few days.
	- Air, this thing sustains them immediately, and if they don't have enough
	  they begin dying immediately.
	- Sporatic(MTTH), this thing is needed randomly, it is added randomly to
	  the pop and continues until it is satisfied.
	- Periodic(Period), this thing is needed periodically, it's added as a need
	  and the pop will continue having it until they're need is satisfied.
	- Baby Need, this thing is needed by babies to be healthy and happy.
	- Child Need, this thing is needed by children to be healthy and happy.
	- Adult Need, this thing is needed by adults to be healthy and happy.
	- Senior Need, this thing is needed by seniors to be healthy and happy.
	Aversions/Anathemas
	- Pollution, this thing causes the population to become unhappy in low
	  levels and increases both health needs and/or death rate at higher
	  levels.
	- Toxin, this thing causes high levels of sickness, requiring much higher
	  medical wants, and drastically increasing death rates and decreasing
	  birth rates.

	Hypothetical Additional Tags
	- Libation/Aphrodesiac, this thing increases the rate of birth for the 
	  populace. Meant for species that require some secondary assistance
	  to have children and otherwise have low birth rates.
	- Radioactive, like toxin, but different.
	- Lethal, like toxin but worse.
