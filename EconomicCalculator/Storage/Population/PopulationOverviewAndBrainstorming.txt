Population Overview

Population (See PopulationGroup) is the abstracted smallest unit of population the
system works with, any economic activity done by an individual is treated as part of
the population group and it's effects are averaged out across the group. 

A populationGroup also has a Culture Breakdown, which defines what cultures exist in
the population group and in what proportion.

The last largest thing a PopulationGroup has is a Job which they do.
