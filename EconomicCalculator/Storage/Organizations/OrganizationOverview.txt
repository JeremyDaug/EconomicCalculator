- Company
	A collection of jobs and processes which, when managed, are more economically efficient by
	combining buying and selling, they are limited within a singular market area, but can take
	almost any form. For companies to combine, they must either share a job, product output,
	the job must output into their inputs, or the job takes an input from their output.
- Corporation
	A collection of companies across multiple markets, it also increases efficiency, with some
	additional overhead. It can enforce product price equivalence across multiple markets, but
	has a tendency to push prices upwards if allowed.
