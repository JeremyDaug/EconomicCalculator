Market Overview

Markets are the workhorse of the system, and do most of the heavy lifting. They
Markets connect together
	- The population of the market who buy, sell, and process products.
	- The Territory of the market which applies physical limitations and 
		connects it to other territories and markets.
	- The prices of Products, which are defined and stored on the basis of a market.
	- The Organizations which control various aspects of the market
		-> Governors primarily control territory and taxation.
		-> Companies primarily control Jobs.


Consolidation, Integration, and Disintegration
	- Integration is the process by which markets merge. Integration happens naturally when 
	  two adjacent markets have a high enough level of infrastructure that a person could
	  (hypothetically) travel from any point to any other point and back in one market day.
	  Integration takes these two territories and effectively combines them under the same
	  market. Because this process is natural, it can happen with no intervention from the
  	  governor and upkeep for this is covered by the upkeep needed for the infrastructure.
	- Consolidation, like integration merges markets, covering multiple territories under
	  one unified market. Unlike integration, this process is unnatural, instituted by a
	  governor and has additional costs. This additional cost is in the form of bureaucrats
	  and additional costs on all products in the consolidated market. While this is more
	  expensive than Integration, it should help accelerate the process of integration.
	- Disintegration is the opposite of Consolidation and Integration. When it occurs it
	  causes the population in each to split in two. This causes immediate problems as local
	  supply chains breakdown and must be overcome. Infrastructure workers between them
	  shift immediately to adjacent merchants to cover this, but costs will still increase
	  and efficiency will be lost.


The Market Day
	Each 'day', which could be a literal day or another arbitrarily defined unit of time,
	the market goes through this cycle of actions to push the market forward.
	In order
	1. Labor Sell Phase
		- Labor has no requirements, and so can sell preemptively, helping move
		  production forward.
	3. Sell Phase
		- All other products are put up for sale, so long as they are not needed by 
		  a later phase of the day (Consumption/Production).
	4. Local Merchants Buy
		- Local Merchants get first dibs on everything because it is their job and they
		  have more storage generally, they also increase the price appropriately.
	5. General Buy Phase
		- After Merchants buy, then everyone else in the market can buy.
	6. Travelling Merchant Buy Phase
		- Once the Market has gotten what it can/need from itself travelling merchants get
		  to buy the rest.
	7. Production Phase
		- Any jobs that can be done are gone through, consuming their inputs, and producing
		  their outputs into local storage.
	8. Consumption Phase
		- All pops consume what they are able to, destroying the products and producing 
		  waste if that is being taken into account.
	9. Loss Phase
		- With all transactions complete, run a loss phase and see what breaks down.
	10. Pop Growth Phase
		- With our work for the day done, begin growing the populations, scaling to how
		  well they met their needs.
	11. Pop Shift Phase
		- After adding population begin shifting some population around from low margin
		  work to high margin work. People want to get rich.
	12. Price Recalculation Phase
		- With everything said and done, update prices based on the size of shortage or
		  surplus in the market with the goods.
