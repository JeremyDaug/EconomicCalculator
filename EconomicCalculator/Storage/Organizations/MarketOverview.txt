Market Overview

Markets are the workhorse of the system, and do most of the heavy lifting. They
Markets connect together
	- The population of the market who buy, sell, and process products.
	- The Territory of the market which applies physical limitations and 
		connects it to other territories and markets.
	- The prices of Products, which are defined and stored on the basis of a market.
	- The Organizations which control various aspects of the market
		-> Governors primarily control territory and taxation.
		-> Companies primarily control Jobs.

The Market Day
	Each 'day', which could be a literal day or another arbitrarily defined unit of time,
	the market goes through this cycle of actions to push the market forward.
	In order
	1. Labor Sell Phase
		- Labor has no requirements, and so can sell preemptively, helping move
		  production forward.
	3. Sell Phase
		- All other products are put up for sale, so long as they are not needed by 
		  a later phase of the day (Consumption/Production).
	4. Local Merchants Buy
		- Local Merchants get first dibs on everything because it is their job and they
		  have more storage generally, they also increase the price appropriately.
	5. General Buy Phase
		- After Merchants buy, then everyone else in the market can buy.
	6. Travelling Merchant Buy Phase
		- Once the Market has gotten what it can/need from itself travelling merchants get
		  to buy the rest.
	7. Production Phase
		- Any jobs that can be done are gone through, consuming their inputs, and producing
		  their outputs into local storage.
	8. Consumption Phase
		- All pops consume what they are able to, destroying the products and producing 
		  waste if that is being taken into account.
	9. Loss Phase
		- With all transactions complete, run a loss phase and see what breaks down.
	10. Pop Growth Phase
		- With our work for the day done, begin growing the populations, scaling to how
		  well they met their needs.
	11. Pop Shift Phase
		- After adding population begin shifting some population around from low margin
		  work to high margin work. People want to get rich.
	12. Price Recalculation Phase
		- With everything said and done, update prices based on the size of shortage or
		  surplus in the market with the goods.
