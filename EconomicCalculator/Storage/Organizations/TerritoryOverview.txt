Territory

Territory is the storage mechanism for physical space, there are a number of methods it
can ... (more stuff think about this later, already have ideas that are relatively
solid, write down later.)


- Land, Land is a unique product which is attached to a territory. Territory generally
  only has so much land, based on it's starting value, and it's often limited in how
  much (if any) land can be reclaimed. Land of differing qualities can be used for
  different things. How these differences are available need to be thought out more
  but there are a few possible methods and ideas.
  - Quality Method, this method treats land based on quality as the determinant. Each
    quality level has a slightly different meaning relative to normal quality. How this
	would be stored and decided in a territory would need to be thought out. (percentages?)
	This would be the quickest to implement, but may create unforseen problem.
	- 0, rugged, completely useless terrain. Not impossible to use, but requires 
	  more advanced methods to make use of (IE stonecarved housing).
	- 1, Marginal land or wasteland, not particularly fertile, but capable of
	  supporting animals.
	- 2, Arable Land, relatively fertile and capable of supporting crops easily
	  in most cases, though not the best or most efficient.
	- 3, Fertile Land, very fertile land, capable of supporting bountiful crops
	  with ease.
	- 4, Solid Land, land which is perfect for building on, and allows for large
	  constructions with little support or modification to the surrounding terrain.
	- 5, Premium land, not particularly useful in production, but seen as valued due
	  to it's beauty or location (think seaside resort land).
  - Variant Method, instead of using the quality of the land product, instead we use variant
    to store additional data about the land. This means we could have (effectively) infinite
	types of land. How this would be stored would, again, require some extra steps.
	- Land Types
	  - Rugged, unusable due to highly rugged terrain (such as rocks or sharp hills)
	  - Marginal, difficult to impossible to farm, but capable of supporting some farm animals.
	  - Arable, Farmable land, but not high quality.
	  - Fertile, Farmable land of high quality.
	  - Wastelands, land which is not really usable by civilization.
	    - Swamps
		- Deserts
		- Rocky outcrops
	  - Water Surface, territory which holds water and is thus impossible to build on directly.
		- Ocean, reclaimable
		- Lake, reclaimable
		- River, must be redirected.
