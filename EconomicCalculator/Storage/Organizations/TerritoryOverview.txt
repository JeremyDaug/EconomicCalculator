Territory

Territory is the storage mechanism for physical space, there are a number of methods it
can ... (more stuff think about this later, already have ideas that are relatively
solid, write down later.)


- Territory Combination - See Market Overview on how territories are combined and unified.

- Territory Organization, Territories can be organized into groups artificially by the 
  governors. These are organizations which help governors, and other organizations navigate
  and organize. The (hypothetical) heirarchy of organization from the top down.
  - Sector
    - Subsector (Possibly Optional)
	  - System
	    - Planet
		  - Continent
		    - Region
			  - State
			    - Providince
				  - Territory (base)
  - Integration and Consolidation is discouraged between territories which are in different
    parts of the same level. IE, Territories in the same providince take precedence over
	territories in different providences when consolidation or integration is being sought.

- Resources in Territories.
  - I can think of a few ways to limit resources in a territory. Some are reasonable but 
    simple, many are crazy, but satisfy my desire for verisimilitude.
	- Tap Method, the tap method treats the local resources of the territory as a tap into
	  the global resources. This method makes resources of a territory effectively permanent
	  but as it draws from the global pile, it simplifies the book keeping on both sides.
	  The territory would only need the connection, to the parent body, nothing more.
	  However, this makes biological resources harder to deal with as the planet's whole
	  biosphere becomes interlinked too strongly.
	- Pile Method, The pile Method gives a territory a strictly limited resources.
	  Territories are given a strict amount of resources and these can and will eventually 
	  be depleted. This method may be the best option and allow for more other resources
	  such as trees and biology. This however could be very heavy on the DB and make
	  managing the resources of a planet and their export/import may make it impossible.

- Infrastructure, In Territories, infrastructure is a public good available to everyone, or
  if not publicly available, is needed to tap into some other good.
  - Roads/Rails/etc are the primary example. They either add an additional need to the
    populations, roads add vehicle transportation (a want) with the goal of having as many
    seats as there are people if not more. Trains have a ticket cost, which is represented 
    as a cost to everyone in the territory. Merchants also pay to use Rails, but not roads.
    Roads and rails have a throughput limit which must be purchased. If it's limited it becomes
    a soft want. If it's made free and unlimited, shortages of supply will be made known.
	- Road/Rail(X, Y), X is the speed bonus, Y is the available throughput.
  - Communications, Like roads and rails, but instead of moving goods, it moves information.
    Communication costs for organizations decrease as communications increase. Like roads and
    rail, there is an upper limit on hom much they can handle, and so there is a cost to use it.
	Like rail it can me made free by the government, and to which it changes to a common want.
	- Wired(X, Y), X is throughput in data, Y is Connection Range (minimum 1)
  - Electrified, Electrification connects the majority of the territory together with electricity
    this is paid for either out of the electric bill, or by tax payers.
	- Electrified(X), X is the available throughput.
  - Plumbing, the territory has an integrated water system, which allows people to access water
    and sewage, making it easier to deliever clean water and remove waste as well as process either
	one.
	- Plumbing(X, Y), X is the available water input, Y is the available sewage output.
  - Flood Control, the territory has water control mechanisms which reduces the damage of flooding
    by increasing the available water storage, and allowing a certain amount of output on top of
	natural flow.
	-  FloodControl(X, Y), X is the storage Capacity, Y is the extra input and output it applies.
  - Garbage System, a system which collects solid waste from the territory for central processing.
    - GarbageSystem(X), X is Capacity. As a service to be bought, or a public service.
  - Steam Pipes, A system by which heating is centrally created and may use steam generated by other
    means to generate heat.
	- Heat(X) X is Output available as a service to be bought.

- Useful to know. 1 Acre = 4046.8564224 M^2
    To flood an acre 1m deep with water, it would take 4046 (raound to 5000) m^3 of
	water, that is roughly 0.000005 km^3
- Area of a hexagon based on the distance from center to nearest edge is.
    A = 1/2 * P * a
	a is the distance from center to outer edge.
	P is the perimiter which is equal to a/(3^(1/2)).
	A = 1/2 * a^2 / 3^(1/2)
- The area of a territory with Apothem radius 10km = 28.8675134 km^2,
  which is 7,133.3184 Acres
  - For sanity sake we'll round Km^2 to Acre so that it's 1km^2:250acres, this means
    there are 2000 plots per km^2.
  - We'll also round out a Territory to 25km for a 10km hex. Again, to maintain sanity.
  - This means that it takes 2.5%(0.025) of a km^3 of water to cover a hex 1m deep.
    A km^3 will fill a hex 40 m deep.
- Waterways, Water is an important resource. There are 3 methods by which a territory
  can have water. 
  - First is Humidity, measured in annual Rainfall across the territory.
  - Second is Water Level, which measures the amount of water in cubic km. Through some 
    means we use the amount of water to lock off portions of the land.
  - Third is HasRiver and RiverSize, which together state whether flowing body of water
    exists in the territory. If true, then it has an attached flow rate, which defines
	how much water flows through the body of water. It's size is defined by the water
	level.

  - Rivers automatically block off 1% of the available acrage of the territory. Any
    water level in the Territory goes to this 1% first, before flooding the rest of the
	Territory.
  - If the difference between the river enterance and it's exit is particularly great,
    and the river size is particularly large relative to the water level, then the river
	is considered hard to navigate, and if it's bad enough it may be considered
	unnavigable.
  - Rivers and how they flow are defined by their adjacent neighbors. We know flow 
    direction based on elevation of it's neighbors, water goes from high to low. 
	Any neighbor that is higher is flowing in. Generally there should only ever be one
	outflow, but if there are more, than the outflow is split evenly among them.
  - Coastal lakes not possible in the current system. A territory which has a coast
    cannot have a lake. Unrealistic, but a small price to pay.
  - As we treat the Territory as being magically flat, flooding a territory goes
    something like this.
	- It takes 4000 m^3 of water to flood 1 acre of land (500m^3 for a plot). Once there
	  is enough surface water for this to happen, one plot/acre is locked away as flooded.
	- This follows the same logic until the entire Territory is flooded.
	- Once an entire territory is flooded it will attempt to find other locations to put
	  the water at an equivalent or lower elevation. If it finds a valid target it creates
	  a water flow to that target.


- Land, Land is a unique product which is attached to a territory. Territory generally
  only has so much land, based on it's starting value, and it's often limited in how
  much (if any) land can be reclaimed. Land of differing qualities can be used for
  different things. How these differences are available need to be thought out more
  but there are a few possible methods and ideas.
  - Flat Methd, this method is by far the easiest and treats all land within the same
    territory as equivalent. The only exceptions to this is land lost to water such as 
	rivers, lakes, or oceans. This makes it harder to get detail in a individual territory
	or market, but that problem disappears once the markets merge. This is what will be
	used, a more advanced option can be added with relative ease later on.
  - Quality Method, this method treats land based on quality as the determinant. Each
    quality level has a slightly different meaning relative to normal quality. How this
	would be stored and decided in a territory would need to be thought out. (percentages?)
	This would be the quickest to implement, but may create unforseen problem, and is
	limited to what is considered a valid quality level of the system.
	- 0, rugged, completely useless terrain. Not impossible to use, but requires 
	  more advanced methods to make use of (IE stonecarved housing).
	- 1, Marginal land or wasteland, not particularly fertile, but capable of
	  supporting animals.
	- 2, Arable Land, relatively fertile and capable of supporting crops easily
	  in most cases, though not the best or most efficient.
	- 3, Fertile Land, very fertile land, capable of supporting bountiful crops
	  with ease.
	- 4, Solid Land, land which is perfect for building on, and allows for large
	  constructions with little support or modification to the surrounding terrain.
	- 5, Premium land, not particularly useful in production, but seen as valued due
	  to it's beauty or location (think seaside resort land).
  - Variant Method, instead of using the quality of the land product, instead we use variant
    to store additional data about the land. This means we could have (effectively) infinite
	types of land. How this would be stored would, again, require some extra steps and a
	breakdown. However, as the types are fixed from instantiation, it would just be an
	expansion to any existing table of Territory Data.
	- Land Types
	  - Rugged, unusable due to highly rugged terrain (such as rocks or sharp hills)
	  - Marginal, difficult to impossible to farm, but capable of supporting some farm animals.
	  - Arable, Farmable land, but not high quality.
	  - Fertile, Farmable land of high quality.
	  - Wastelands, land which is not really usable by civilization.
	    - Swamps
		- Deserts
		- Rocky outcrops
	  - Water Surface, territory which holds water and is thus impossible to build on directly.
		- Ocean, reclaimable
		- Lake, reclaimable, drainable.
		- River, must be redirected.
  - Land Ranks, land is divided by categories with the following axes.
	- Fertility, Barren, Marginal, Arable, Fertile
	- Passability, Open, Flat, Hilly, Rugged, Mountainous
	- Humidity, Dry to wet
	- Tempurature, fridgid to hot
